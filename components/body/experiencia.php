                I work using Drupal and Laravel. The most outstanding activities of my work were
                modifying the behavior of existing modules and packages, creating pipelines to create
                continuous integration with tools such as circleci and github actions.

              during my time as an independent programmer I created a
              framework in PHP with MySQL [Argus] using the MVC design proton,
              with which I developed different projects for a private client.
              One of my outstanding achievements was to develop a large part of
              the system to create electronic titles for the state of Veracruz.

            In this job I was developing on a company's own
            framework in which I helped to correct existing modules
            and create new modules for it. One of my outstanding
            achievements was to reduce the loading time
            from 15 seconds to 4 seconds in critical parts of the system.
